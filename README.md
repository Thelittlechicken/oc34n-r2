## THIS TOOL IS LICENSED UNDER GPLv3, WE WILL DMCA YOU IF YOU USE IT WITHOUT FOLLOWING THE CONDITIONS OF GPLv3.

New and refined tool for Factory Activation. Made with Oc34n's activation server in mind (https://oc34n.pw).  
THIS IS NOT FREE. YOU CAN MODIFY IT WITH A DIFFERENT ACTIVATION SERVER, BUT THE ONE USED IS OC34N.

Written in C# using .NET Framework with the purpose of activating the device with MobileDevice
